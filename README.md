## How to Get Them
Go to the page of [**Release**](https://github.com/Blatke/Naughty-Tongue/releases) on the right side and download the latest mod file.

Install them by dragging and dropping the mod file into the **/mods/** folder or via KKManager, without running your Studio.

## How to Use Them
Go finding them in Studio by their item names. Add the tongue into the scene, parent it to your character's mouth and set the tongue's position to 0,0,0. Then, the tongue goes near by the chara's mouth, and you just need a little further adjustment in its position.

Also, you can disable the original tongue of the chara to let there not be two tongues clipping in the mouth. Select the chara, open **MaterialEditor**, and find and toggle the renderer of **o_tang** to **OFF**.

For changing the colors, select the tongue and use **MaterialEditor**.

For animating them, enable their **FK** functions on the anim tab, then rotate the FK nodes to change their poses.

There are also some Blend Shapes added to these items, check and adjust their parameters on the **Blend Shapes** tab of the adv.mode of HS2PE/AIPE to morph the mesh of the tongues.
